	<h3>Styling with html vs CSS</h3>
	<p>
	As you may have noticed, some commands that occur in css can also be done in html, for example bold or italics. The differences between them is that, while both make the text look the way we'd like, the browser registers them differently. If &lt;strong&gt; is used, the web browser knows that this particular bolded string is important and will emphasize its importants when registered through things such as reading apps, and search engines. As such, what &lt;strong&gt; does is change the meaning of the element. Font-weight: bold, by contracts, simply changes the way the text is being seen; it can also be used to change the way it looks.

	<h3>flexbox</h3>
	<p>
		<strong>Flexbox</strong> is a way of changing the rules for how boxes are laid out onto the page in a way that is more flexable.(display:flex) This causes elements to float right and also allows the element to resize to fit the screen. It also allows us to customize how the elements will behave when there isn't enough room on the screen by messing with the flex-wrap property.
