<h3>Opening, closing, and reading file</h3>
<p>
	To open and read a text file in python use the command open and assign
	<strong>open(filename)</strong> to a variable. Once you have the file open use
	the command <strong>.read()</strong> to return the content of the text file.
	When you are done with a text file, you want to close it to make sure that you
	don't hit the limit of open file of your computer while running the program.
	To close a file, type the file name followed by <strong>.close()</strong>.
	Keep in mind if you close a file, you can't read from that file.
	To avoid complication when using the content of the file, you can use the
	compound statment <strong>with open("textfilename") as variable:</strong>
	followed by the command you want to run before closing the file.
</p>
<h3>Removing punctuations from strings</h3>
<p>
	Sometimes when you are searching for a string, a punctuation gets in the way
	of the program recognizing "pie!" being the same thing as "pie". To prevent
	this, use the <strong>.strip()</strong> method on strings. This will remove a
	specific character if it is found at the beginning or end.
</p>
<h3>Writing output to a file</h3>
<p>
	When you are writing a program, you want it to cause changes to certain
	strings. One way to do this is to pull the string from a text file and then
	<strong>write to the file</strong> The steps for writing to a file is as
	follow:
	<ul>
		<li>Open the file in write mode</li>
		<li>Use the write method to write to the file</li>
		<li>Close the file.</li>
	</ul>
	Write mode is an addition feature of the open function. By default, when you
	use the open function, it is in a <strong>read only mode</strong>. To active
	<strong>write mode</strong>, add the additional argument <strong>"w"</strong>.
	Bear in mind that when you are using rite mode, you are replace the content of
	the file, there is no undo. If; however, you use the open method with a file
	name that doens't exist, it will create a new file. To use the write method,
	just like file_variable.write("string"). Keep in mind, the write method only
	works with strings.
</p>
<h3>Web API</h3>
<p>
	API stands for <strong>Application Programming Interface</strong> which means
	that the doe interacts with some other code or application. An examples of API
	are the turtle module. API can also refer to code which isn't built into
	python, but also programs that aren't running on your computer. Using web API
	can potentially cause some problems due to web servers being down or a
	disconnection from the internet.
</p>
<h3>Getting the weather</h3>
<p>
	When typing using urls in python or the shell, it is important to remember
	that having spaces in url names is not safe. In a browser, by default, this is
	normally automatically change to %20 where the space is, but in python or the
	shell, you'll have to write the %20 yourself.
</p>
<h3>Request module</h3>
<p>
	When you want to use Web API, you need to be able to make request on the web.
	You can make request by downloading the request module from this <a href="
	http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/install/#install">link</a>
	To use the function <strong>get</strong> which takes in a string(the url. It
	must include either http or https) and returns &lt;Response [200]&gt; if link
	is valid, otherwise it will return &lt;Response [404]&gt;(as in error 404).
	Keep in mind that response[200] isn't literly what the function returns, but
	to see and interact with the response from the server, assign request.get() to
	a variable. Side note, the number 200 in html refers to if the request has
	been completed properly. To view the contents of the return, use the variable
	you assigned request.get() to and follow it by <strong>.text</strong>.
</p>
<h3>Problems with API</h3>
<p>
	Programs that work with web API's are catagorized as <strong>non-deterministic
	</strong>, as in, they can do something different each time. In truth, when
	using an API, the desired result might be different due to internet problems,
	or the server being down. Programs you write will need to be able to handle
	the possibiility of the networking request failing. IF the request was sent,
	but there was an error on the server, the status code function .status_code
	will return 404 and a traceback. If there is a problem with your internet, it
	will result in a traceback.
</p>
<h3>Try and exception</h3>
<p>
	Error messages such as NameError, TypeError, OSError, and ZeroDivisionError
	are actually special values in python known as an <strong>exception</strong>.
	When an an exception occurs, it is known as <strong>raising an exception</strong>
	and it just signals that an error has occurred. An exception is a problem that
	is detected when the code is running. By default, when an exception occurs,
	python exits the program and displays a traceback. To change what occurs when
	python finds an exception, is to use the <strong>try-except</strong> statement.
	A try except statement takes a command and tries to run it, it will do this
	normally <strong>except</strong> when a certain error occurs, then it will
	do a listed command. It is similar to an if statement. The only type of Error
	that cannot be used in a try statement is syntax errors.
	 A try statement looks like this:
	<br>
	try:
	<br>
		print(x/y)
		<br>
	except ZeroDivisionError:
	<br>
		print (z)
	<br>
	When using the requests module, and a connection error has occured, the requests
	module has an exception for when you have trouble connecting which is:
	<strong>requests.exceoptions.ConnectionError</strong>, this exception can be
	be paired with an if statment.
</p>
<h3>JSON</h3>
<p>
	When you use the .text function on the web API for weather, it will return a long set of
	text. This is known as <strong>JSON</strong> which stands for JavaScript object
	Notation. JSON is not a program but rather a piece of data. It is used to send
	nested data strctures that contain strings, numbers, list, and key-value pairs.
	For more on JSON, check this <a href="https://www.json.org/">link</a>
</p>
<h3>Dictionaries</h3>
<p>
	Another useful type of data strcture we can use(besides list), is a <strong>
	dictionary</strong>. Dictionaries can contain multiple items like a list;
	however, they do not use index numbers to obtain the items. To create an empty
	dictionary, just type x = {}. If you want content in the dictionary, type:
	x = <strong>"key": "value"</strong>; if you have more than one entry, seperate
	them with a ",". If you want to look up an entry from a dictionary, use the
	x["key"] with the key and it will return whatever is assigned the value. If
	you want to change a value, type x["key"] = value. To add to a value, type
	x["key"] += value. To add a new key and a value to an existing dictionary,
	type x["newkey"] = "new_value". If you try to use a key that isn't in a
	dictionary, it will result in a <strong>KeyError</strong>. The <strong>in
	</strong> operator works with dictionaries. x in d(dictionary) will result in
	the program searching for the key "x" and will return true if it is a valid
	lookup. If you write <strong>del x['key']</strong>, it will remove the key and its values from
	the dictionary(x)
</p>
<h3>Looping over dictionaries</h3>
<p>
	When using a for loop(for x in y) with a dictionary, <strong>x becomes the key by
	default</strong>. You can also get the same result by typing <strong>for x in
	y.keys()</strong>.To obtain the values, you can type <strong>for x in
	y.values().</strong> If you want both the key and the value, type <strong>
	for x in y.items()</strong> If you want to assign the key and value to
	different variables, type <strong>for key, value, in favorites.items()</strong>
	When you print out full dictionary entries, it looks like (x,y). This is known
	as <strong>tuple</strong> Tuples are sequences that are immutable
</p>
<h3>Nesting dictionary</h3>
<p>
	Keys can only nest <strong>integer and strings</strong>. Values, on the other
	hand can hold <strong>integers, list, strings, and dictionaries</strong>. Lists
	can nest dictionaries, you can also do more complex commands sucn as
	d["x"[0]"y"], this will return the values in key "x" and select the first item
	on the list with index[0] and return the values of the inner key 'y'
</p>
<h2>Looping over nested strcture</h2>
<p>
	If you are looping over a list, keep in mind that if you have a list nested in
	the other list, you can use for x in y[0] to specifically target the first
	list. Likewise, you can also use for x in y["dictionary_name"].keys(or values)
	to list over specific dictionaries. You can continuously index through
	layers of nexting by continuously using the index operator back to back.
</p>
<h3>Magical Dictionary Transformation</h3>
<p>
	When using web API, chances are they are written in JSON. To use this data in
	python, just add x.json() to the variable that holds the API to turn JSON into
	a python dictionary.
</p>
<h4>Random side note:</h4>
<p>
	If you include a \t in your string, it will automatically insert a tab to space
	the text farther apart.
</p>
<h3>Objects and Class</h3>
<p>
	Object are things in memory that we can refer to by a name. They also have a
	specific <strong>type</strong>(str, int, list, boolean). These types specify
	what we can do with that object. For example we can /(divide) an integer but
	we cannot divide a string. Another way to refer to type is to refer to it as a
	<strong>class</strong> (str, int, turtle, etc). A class is a template or blueprint
	for creating objects. For example, the input function always return an object
	whose class is a string. To check what class an object is, use the functions
	<strong>isinstance and type</strong>. Isinstance takes a particular object and
	checks if it is a certain class or belong to a class and will return a boolean
	value. Type take an object and will return &lt;class"_"&gt; and the name of
	the class in the blank. Once an object is created, the class does not change.
	To create an object with a certain class, just use str() for string, int() for
	int, turtle.Turtle() for turtle, and so on.(just call it) Side note, boolean
	value fall in the int class.
</p>
<h3>Defining a new class</h3>
<p>
	To define a class, just type class followed by the name of the class plus a
	colon. For example class Dog:. After creating a class, define the function you
	would like that class to be able to do. Keep in mind that a method is a function
	written inside of a class so we can use it. Keep in mind that when you have 1
	argument in a class definition, the class name is automatically inserted as the
	first argument, normally the first parameter is written as self(most people
	do it this way.)
</p>
<h3>Class Variables and instance-level variables</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Class level variable</strong> are variables found in classes. They are
	created by using assignment statements inside of the class difinition. This is
	useful when there is information that is common amoung all instances of a class.
</p>
<p>
	When you assign a variable a name, the variable name points to an object, but
	there is no way to reverse this process. The varaible Fido can point to a
	object, but theres no way for that object to know that it's variable name is
	Fido. To allow the object ot refer to the variable, you can use a
	<strong>Instance level variables</strong>.To use an instance level variable,
	use an assignment statement to a variable starting with <strong>self.</strong>,
	this saves information into a single specific object that you called the method
	on. For example, if you define a function that takes self and a name, to make
	it an instance level variable, just type self.name = name inside. Now if you
	type the variable self.name, it will return whatever you assigned to the argument,
	name. Keep in mind, instance-level variables work the same as regular variables,
	they are also mutable.
</p>
<h3>Initializer(__init__)</h3>
<p>
	An <strong>Initializer</strong> is a special way of defining a function that
	automatically gets run when you create an object with a class. For example, if
	in our dog program, we wanted the dog to know its name as soon as it was created,
	we would put the variable self.name = name inside the __init__ function. Keep
	in mind, this does require that when you use a class, you are required to pass
	an argument.
</p>
<h3>Subclassing and "Is-a" vs "Has-a"</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Subclassing(Inheritance)</strong> is when a class shares characteristic
	with a parent class. For example, if we had a class, dog, that had a speak
	function, if we make husky a subclass of dog, husky can also use the speak
	function without having to redefine it. To set up a subclass, type
	class classname(parentclass)
</p>
<p>
	When determining if something should be a subclass of another, we must consider
	it's relationship to the original class. The relationship rules we go by is
	is known as a <strong>"Is-a" vs "Has-a"</strong>. If we want something to be
	a subclass of another, it should be directly related to it. For example, a
	Corgi is a type of dog; therefore, we can make a subclass for the Corgi. On the
	contrast, a dog park has a dog in it, but isn't actually a dog itself; it is a
	park.
</p>
<h3>Super</h3>
<p>
	Sometimes when you are importing other modules, it is important to keep in mind
	that sometimes the original module has a __init__ in it; therefore, if you use
	another __init__ for a subclass, it will override the original module init. To
	avoid this use the <strong>super function</strong>. The super function takes
	the object and connect it to its parents class. In other words, it allows you
	to access what would have originally been created by the init of the parent
	module. The super function looks like <strong>super().__init__()</strong>
