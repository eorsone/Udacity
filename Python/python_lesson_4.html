	<h3>Substring</h3>
	<p>
		A substring is a smaller string that is contained within a larger string. For example "app" is a substring of "apple". The character must occur in order with no gaps in the larger string. Spacing, capitalization and punctuation must match as well. To check if a substring is inside another string, just type " x <strong>in</strong> y" and the result will either be True or False. It can be used to search strings and list. Keep in mind if you type something like [2,3] in [1,2,3,4], it will result in false because it is looking for exactly [2,3] so for it to be true it would have to be [1,[2,3],4]. There is also a <strong>not in</strong> function that does the opposite. T
	</p>
	<p>
		To locate the position of a substring in a string, you can use the <strong>find</strong> method. To use this method just type "string".find("substring") This will return the value of the position where the substring begins. If the substring is not found, the find method will return -1. This works only on strings.
	</p>
	<p>
		To count the amount of substrings in a strings, you can use the <strong>count</strong> method. To use count, simply type string.count(substring). This will return the amount of times you can find substring in string. If you use .count on a list, it will return the amount of times you can find the item on the list, but not if its in another list. For example, [1,2,1,3].count(1) will return 2 and [1,[1,2],3].count([1,2]) will return 1 but [1,2,1,3].count([1,2]) will return 0.
	</p>
	<h3>Joining</h3>
	<p>
		If we wanted to put a list of strings together in a single string, we can use the <strong>join</strong> method. The fuction will a string and a list and put the items in the list together seperated by the string. For example, if we type " ".join["hi", "there!"] it will result in "hi" + " " + "there!"". Join also works with variables. If you don't want anything between the string on the list you can simply put "". This only works on strings. If you write '-'.join("cat"), the result will be 'c-a-t'
	</p>

	<h3>Pycodestyle</h3>

	<p>
		the command pycodestyle is a tool you can use to check your python code to see if it matches the python style guide. To use this, simply type 'pycodestyle' followed by 'your_program.py'. This will be followed by a message that looks like 'your_program.py:3:1' followed by an explanation. The first number represents the line which the mistake was found. If there are no problems, it won't print anything at all.
	</p>
	<h3>Multi-line </h3>
	<p>
		Sometimes a string will extend off-screen, making the code harder to read. To prevent this while also getting the same results, you should include a "+ \" right before where you would normally hit enter. An alternative method would be to surround the string with ()
	</p>
	<p>
		When trying to avoid EOL character error, one way is the enter a \ before hitting enter, this is known as a <strong>explicit line joining</strong>. Another way to join line is through <strong>implicit line-joining</strong>, this is anything inside parentheses (). When inside () python will treat the line as if it was a single long line, but the spacing will remain. Python automatically concatenates(+) any adjacent string literals, even without the +. For example, if you type "foo" + "bar" you get foobar, but also if you type "foo""bar" it will also return foobar

	<h3>Writing Breakfast bot</h3>
	<p>
		Here are some random notes when you are working on the breakfast bot:
		<ul>
			<li>If you type \n before closing the quotes while using the input function, it will print the written input on the next line.</li>
			<li>If you use the string method .lower() it will turn the string its attached to, string.lower, into all lower case letters</li>
			<li>To put a pause in your program for a set period of time, use the time modules and the sleep function it should look like time.sleep(2)</li>

		</ul>
	</p>
	<h3>Files with python</h3>
	<p>
		A file can contain text or other data, so how does it vary from a string or variable in python. A file is in <strong>persistent storage</strong>, meaning it is piece of memory stored on the pc unless erased. Variable and strings are ephemeral, only lasting as long as the program is still running. A file can be used my multiple programs, where as variables are stuck to a single program.
	</p>
	<h3>OS module</h3>
	<p>
		The <strong>os</strong> module allows the user to implement operating system dependent functionality to their code. Here are some useful function you will use from the os module.
		<ul>
			<li><strong>os.lisdir()</strong> - gives a list of file names in a directory. Take in the path as the argument</li>
			<li><strong>os.mkdir()</strong> - creats a directory. Usese the argument as the directory name</li>
			<li><strong>os.rename()</strong> - renames a file(by taking in the full path of the file and replacing it with the second argument) can be used to move files as well.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h3>Relative paths and current working directory</h3>
	<p>
		Like when you were learning about how to use the command line, python also has a current working directory. It basically means the exact same thing. When trying to move files, you should keep in mind what directory you are currently in, and where the directory you want to move the file is. Remember to make use of relative paths and absolute paths when needed. Here are some useful functions:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>os.getcwd()</strong> - gives you the current working directory</li>
			<li><strong>os.chdir()</strong> - allows you to change directory</li>
		</ul>
	<h3>os functions and shell commands</h3>
	<p>
		One important thing to keep in mind when using os functions is that the directories are displayed differently between windows, mac, and linex. One way to make sure you are writing <strong>portable code</strong>- code that works on all systems, is to use the fuction os.path.join. This will append the strings differently depending on the operating system and allow the code to be used on all systems.
	</p>
	<h3>Split module</h3>
	<p>
		The split method removes a substring from a string and return the items between the substring as a list. for example "banana".split("n") removes all "n" and return ['ba', 'a', 'a']
	</p>
	<h3>Script Footer</h3>
	<p>
		All programs have something known as a <strong>double-underscore("dunder") variable</strong>. Dunder variable look like __name__ and __main__. These are assigned when the program is run by mean of import or direct execution. If it is run directly,__name__ becomes __main__; if imported __name__ will be assigned to the name of the program(without the .py)
