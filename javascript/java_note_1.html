    <h3>Javascript Console</h3>
    <p>
      To view the Javascript console, right click and hit inspect. After
      inspecting, go to the Console tab. You can also use Ctrl + Shift + J.
      You can enter strings into the console like "Bob". If you use
      <strong>alert("string")</strong>, you can make a pop up with text. The Javascript
      console, like the python console, is convient when you are using short
      code, but longer code, for the same reasons as python, will become
      tedious. Text editors are recommended, but there are other ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      The console is a like a sandbox, it is a place to try code without
      any risk or consequences. You can use it to debug or test code. If you
      want to display content in the console, use <strong>console.log</strong>.
      This allows you to run code and print strings in the console.
    </p>

    <h3>Data types</h3>
    <p>
      Similar to python, Java uses certain datatypes that help identify work
      with different information.
    </p>

    <h3>Numbers</h3>
    <p>

          To define a number, all you have to do is write the number. It can be
          positive, negative, or even a decimal. With these values, you can
          do operations such as 1 + 1. You can also compare number, by using
          &lt;&gt;&lt;= &gt= != and == (these return boolean values).
    </p>
    <h3>Comments</h3>
    <p>
        To comment things out, it can be anything after a // or anything between
        /*... /*
    </p>
    <h3>String</h3>
    <p>
      Strings are indicated by text written between "" or ''. In javascript you
      can concatenate strings together like "hi"  + " friend." keep in mind, you
      have to include the space in the quotes otherwise it will look likethis.
      In javascript, you can concatenate strings and integers, If there is an
      operation, it will give you the result of the operation, "mob" + 10*10
      will return mob100. This unique feature is known as implicit type
      coercion.
    </p>
    <h3>Variables</h3>
    <p>
      Variables are used to store data. They can store any data into a varaible.
      To create a variable, type <strong>var variableName = value;</strong>. In
      javascript, you write variable name with the first letter of the first
      word in lowercase and the next words start with uppercase. This is known
      as camelCase. itLooksLikeThis. Using camelCase is not required, but it
      is considered the normal practice when working in javascript.
    </p>
    <h3>String Indexing</h3>
    <p>
      Strings can be index to return a specific letter in the string. To index
      a string, type <strong>"string"[number]</strong>. This will return the
      number located at the corresponding positon. Keep in mind that index start
      from 0 so "string"[0] will return "s". Indexing also works on variables.
      Empty spaces in a string also count as a position on index.
    </p>
    <h3>Escape Character</h3>
    <p>
      In javascript, to avoid syntax errors in strings that have quotes, use the
      <strong>escape character \</strong> before the quote. The escape character
      tells javascript to ignore any sort of special meaning behind a character
      and use it literally. Some common special character are: \\ \" \'
      \n(newline) \t(tab)
    </p>

    <h3>Comparing Strings</h3>
    <p>
      You can use the == and != operator to compare strings. For example,
      "hi" == "hi". Keep in mind, by default, the text has to be exactly the
      same to return the value True. One thing to keep in mind, if you are
      comparing string with &lt; &gt;, it will return True or False based on the
      letters ASCII table code. For more on this go <a href=
      "http://www.ascii-code.com"> here</a>
    </p>
    <h3>Null, Undefined, and NaN</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Null</strong> and <strong>Undefined</strong> are two values that
      seem very similar at first, but are different in what they actually
      do. Null refers to a variable that has no value, like None, it purposely
      return nothing, or null. Undefined means that there is no value assigned
      to it. Null looks like var x = null; undefined looks like var x;. NaN
      stands for Not-a-number and often appears when there is an error with
      number operation. For example, Nan might appear if you try to divide a
      string by a number or if you try to calculate something that is not
      possible (like square root of a negative number.)
    </p>

    <h3>Equlity</h3>
    <p>
      Javascript is interesting in the way it treats number and strings. In
      python, you know that strings and integers cannot be used together; but
      with javascript, it is different. '1' == 1 is True and 0 == false is True.
      This is because javascript is a <strong>loosely typed language</strong>.
      This means that you do not have to specify data types in javascript,
      it will automatically convert data into the appropriate data type. This is
      why "julia" + 1 is "julia1". Programming languages like python, that types
      need to be specified, are known as <strong>strongly typed languages</strong>.
      It is considered bad practice to compare values for equality with == and !=
      because they convert value in way you don't want. If you want strict
      equality, type an extra = instead of == or != it should be === and !==
    </p>

    <h3>Semicolons</h3>
    <p>
      In Javascript, it is possible to write more than one statement on a single
      line. This is due to the statements in javascript ending in <strong>;
      </strong>. If this isn't included, you will get a syntaxerror. Some errors
      can occur if you don't include the semicolon at the end of the line, so it
      is best to include it at all time.
    </p>

    <h3>If else statements</h3>
    <p>
      An if else statements allows you to print out a certain piece of code if
      a certain condition is met. They look like this:
    </p>
    <br>
    <img src = "if_statement.png" alt = "if_statement">
    <br>
    <p>
      Keep in mind that inside an if statement, the value is always converted
      to true or false. If you want more than two conditions, you can add
      another with else if.
    </p>

    <h3>Logical Operators</h3>
    <p>
      If you want an and statement in javascript, you use the && character
      between the two conditions. x === "x" && y === "y". These are logical
      operators and they boolean values. The <strong>||</strong> characters are
      used for or statements. And ! is used for not statement. Look at the
      diagram below. You'll notice that if the first expression of an and
      statement is false, both are false regardless. Likewise in an or statement
      if the first expression is true, the rest is true regardless of the second.
      This is known as <strong>short-circuiting</strong> because it
      describes later events in arguments in a logical expression that are not
      considered because the first already satisfied the condition.
      <br>
      <img src ="logical_operators.png" alt = "logical operators image."
      <br>
    </p>

    <h3>Truth and False</h3>
    <p>
      There are some values that when evaluates to false all the time when
      converted. These are the six that exist in javascript:
      <ul>
        <li>False</li>
        <li>null</li>
        <li>undefined</li>
        <li>0</li>
        <li>""</li>
        <li>NaN</li>
      </ul>
      Any other value evaluates to true.
    </p>
    <h3>Ternary Operators</h3>
    <p>
      A <strong>ternary operator</strong> is a shortcut for writting if else
      statement. The format looks like this: condition ? (if true) : (if false);
    </p>
    <h3>Switch Statements</h3>
    <p>
      If you find yourself repeating the statement "else if" in your code, you
      should probably switch over to a <strong>switch statement</strong>. A
      switch statement allows you to access different scenerio based on case
      predefined cases. A switch statment looks like the below code. The words
      case below is similar to writting if. One thing to keep in mind is that if
      option is 1, it will print case 1 till the end. To avoid this, use a break
      statement. At the end of the switch statement, you can include a
      <strong>default</strong> which will always be run regardless what cases
      are met.
      <br>
      switch (option) {
        <br>
        case 1:
        <br>
          console.log("You selected option 1.");
          <br />
        case 2:
        <br />
          console.log("You selected option 2.");
          <br />
      }
    </p>
