    <h3>What is an event?</h3>
    <p>
      An event is like an announcement that envokes a response. One way to view
      events from a page of html is using the funcion monitorEvents() in the
      javascript console of chrome. This function takes in an element and
      returns all the events that are happening on the targetted element. There
      are two ways to stop it, refreshing the page, or typing unmonitorEvent()
      into the console.
    </p>
    <h3>Responding to events</h3>
    <p>
      Going back to html, we stated that elements inherit from nodes, but one
      thing we didn't mention is that nodes inherit from something known as the
      <strong>EventTarget Interface</strong>. The EventTarget is "an interface
      implemented by objects that can receive events and listen to them.
      Elements, documents, and window are the most common event targets, but
      other objects can be event targets too. The EventTarget Interface only has
      three methods:
      <ul>
        <li>.addEventListener - allows us to listen to events and respond.</li>
        <li>.removeEventListener</li>
        <li>.dispatchEvent()</li>
      </ul>
      The addEventListener requires three parameters, a event <strong>target
      </strong>, the <strong>type</strong> of event ot listen for, and a function
      to run when an event occurs known as a <strong>listener</strong>. The
      structure looks like this :
      <br />
      &lt;event-target&gt;.addEventListener(&lt;event-to-listen-for&gt;,
        &lt;function-to-run-when-an-event-happens&gt;);.
      <br />
      The event target can be anything on the web. The event-to-listen-for(type)
      is the event we want to respond to. The
      function-to-run-when-an-event-happens(listner) is the function to run when
      event occurs. For more info go <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener">

    </p>

      To add javascript to your own file, add the element &lt;script src = "" &gt;
      &lt;/script&gt; To view all DOM events, go <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events">
