    <h3>Loops</h3>
    <p>
      To avoid repeating the same code several times, it best to use a loop.
      Loops will continuously iterate around a piece of code. Loops can be
      nested.
      To set up a while loop, type while (condition) {what is being looped}.
    </p>
    <p>
      A for loop is the most common type of loop used in javascript. For loops
      force you to define the start , end point, and increments
      of a loop in the for statement. For example for
      (var x = 1; x < 10; x++) This set the variable and starting point,
      continues while x < 10, and increase x by 1 each time through the loop.
      Note that x++ is a different way of writting x += or x = x + 1;however,
      there is a difference. If you type x++, it will return the current number
      and change the value of x by 1. Similarly, ++x will return x + 1. It all
      depends on what the program needs. You can also use this when subtracting.
    </p>
    <h3>Functions</h3>
    <p>
      Function is a way of packaging up code and making it more simple use,
      without the need to consistantly copy and paste long code. A function
      normally takes in arguments, and return the result of affecting the
      argument in a certain way. The variable are known as parameters, the
      actual value of those variables are known as arguments. Return statements
      are used to make the function return a value. Once defined, you can call a
      function when you want to use it.
    </p>
    <h3>console.log() vs return</h3>
    <p>
      You may noticed that when you used console.log() it return whatever is in
      the () followed by <strong>undefined</strong>. Undefined is what is being
      return by the console.log() function. More specifically undefined is the
      result of a function not having any specified value for it to return. This
      is because a function must always return something. Another way to print
      messages is to use the word <strong>return</strong>. Returns are used to
      <strong>stop the execution of a function</strong> and return a value back
      to the caller. Console.log can print text but it is not a return statement.
      If a return statement is present, console.log will not return undefined.
    </p>
    <h3>Scope</h3>
    <p>
      Scope will be at the heart of many programming problem. Scope is the part
      of a program where a particular identifier(variable or function name)
      is visible or accessible. In javascript there are two different type of
      scope, global scope and function scope. If you have an identifier outside
      of any function, it can be accessed anywhere in the code after it is
      defined, this is known as global scope. If you have a identifer inside a
      function, that identifier can be accessed only inside the function and
      any other nested function. This is known as function scope. Variables
      in function scope only affect the value inside that scope, if x = 1 and
      in a function you multiply x by 3; outside that function, x is still 1.
    </p>
    <h3>Hoisting</h3>
    <p>
      Hoisting is a unique feature to javascript that allows all function and
      variables to be declared before the code even runs in the current scope.
      This makes it so a function can be used before it is written. In the case
      of variables, it is actually a bad thing to use hoisting, due to the fact
      that the variable is defined, but the assignment with that variable
      isn't hoisted with the variable. This is why, in the case of variables,
      you want to define them on the top of the current scope. It is common
      practice to avoid using hoisting, and stick to the top-to-bottom standard
      way of writting code.
    </p>
    <h3>Function Expression</h3>
    <p>
      A <strong>function expression</strong> is a function stored in a variable.
      A function expression looks like var x = function(parameter){}. If you
      want to use the function expression, just type the variable name followed
      by the argument you want to pass(if any). Notice how the function has
      no name, this is known as a <strong>annonymous function</strong>.
      Annonymous functions can be named, but you would still have to use the
      variable name, not the function name. Function expression, unlike function
      declaration(the noraml way) are not affected by hoisting.
    </p>
    <p>
      With function expressions, you are able to pass functions into other
      functions. This is known as a <strong>callback</strong>. If you skip the
      assignment, you can still perform a callback. It looks like
      movies(function nameOfFunction(parameter){command;}) There is an example
      below. The function below returns the string "My favorite movie is
      Finding Nemo."
      <br />
      <img src = "inline.png" alt = "inline example" />
      <br />
      You might be wondering why we would want to use an anonymous inline
      function. Anonymous inline function expressions are often used with
      function callback that aren't going to be reused.
    </p>
    <h3>Arrays</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Arrays</strong> are a data strcture that can hold multiple data
      values, similar to a list. Array, like list in python, start from 0. To
      make an array just create a variable equal to []. var x = [] Eat element
      in an array needs to be seperated with a comma. Array can basically hold
      any value. Each item in an array is known as an element. You can refer
      to different items in an array using indexing. Keep in mind, if you try
      to access an element at an index that doesn't exist, undefined will be
      returned. Additionally, you can change the value of an element in the
      array by typing index[0] = newvalue;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrays have a number of <strong>properties and methods</strong>.
      Properties are like special pieces of information about a data structure.
      The .length property is one that we have used before on strings. If used
      if arrays, it will return the amount of elements in a array. A method is
      like a special predefined function that data structures can call. Some
      examples are:
      <ul>
        <li>Reverse - reverses the order of the elements in an array</li>
        <li>Sort - sorts elements in an array</li>
        <li>Push & Pop - two methods that allow us to add and remove elements
        from an array. Push() adds to the end of a array, while pop removes
        elements from the end.
        </li>
        <li>.Splice - splice() can add removes an element from anywhere in the
        array by taking in position of what you want to remove, and the position
        where you want something to be moved to, followed by the new elements.
        The first argument is the starting index, the second is the number of
        elements you want to remove, the third is what you want to add.
        </li>
        <li>.shift()- removes the first item in a list.</li>
        <li>.join()- changes an array into a string.</li>
        <li>.forEach() - Used to loop over each elements in an array without an
        index. The forEach function can take a function with up to three
        parameter.(element, index, array)
        </li>
        <li>
          .map(func) - works on callbacks function that can perform an
          operation on each of the elements in the array (similar to forEach) but
          it creates a new array and returns it.
        </li>
        <li>
          .toFixed(n) - rounds number up to n decimal points
        </li>
      </ul>
      side note - Number("n") converts a string back into a number.
    </p>
    <h3>Objects</h3>
    <p>
      Objects allows us to wrap pieces of related data and functionality, and
      place it in a singular container. Arrays are an example of an object, but
      there are several more built-in to javascript, and you can even build your
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      One way to define an object is to create a variable and assign it to a set
      of curly braces. {}. You can confirm what type of object a variable is
      by using the <strong>typeof</strong> operator. Operators have property and
      commands. To add information, use <strong>property keys</strong> and
      associate it with a value. For example color: "blue". Color is the key
      while "blue" is the value. A function that is associated with an object(
      is defined inside the object) is known as a method.
    </p>
    <h3>Primitive Data Types</h3>
    <p>
      primitive data types are things like strings, numbers, booleans, undefined
       and null. Objects are data sctrues in javascript that let you store data
       about a particular thing, and helps keep track of that data by using a
       "key".
